  USE mpi

  IMPLICIT NONE


  INTEGER ierror, rank, size


  CALL MPI_INIT(ierror)

 
 ! Get the rank of each process 

 ! Get the size of the communicator 

 !  Write code such that every process writes its rank and the size of the communicator, but only process 0                          !  prints "hello world"

  CALL MPI_FINALIZE(ierror)
